overview: Designed to be a hybrid of modular pre-fab and site finished construction that would not be attached to, but hung over the concrete wall, the steel and wood hanging bracket frames and most of the redwood pieces were pre-cut and assembled in the shop.

challenge: The objective was to catalyze social interaction by providing sitting, relaxing, socializing, studying, eating, napping, seminar, class, and pin-up space for presenting students’ architectural design projects in an otherwise 'dead-space' within the college building.
